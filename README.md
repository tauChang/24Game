# 24Game
The classic 24 game. Given 4 integers in the range [1, 13], achieve the number 24 using only addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses. Fun as hell.

## Execution
`python3 main.py`

The program will then prompt you for the number of rounds to play, number of players playing, and the players' names (should be unique). Every round, the program will prompt you for the winner of the round. 
After the given amount of rounds, the game ends, and the program announces the winner(s).
